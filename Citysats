Geolocation based advertising with local markets with ln accepting pos merchants appearing on map
application provides users ability to paste the item name or manually type it into search bar
this effectively gives the user the ability to index the local area's retailers for their desired item(s) and its relative price and location
gives user ability to sort by proximity to them as well as item pricing and by quantity if the merchant wants to do wholesale deals.

If merchants had the ability to send both ads and limited time digital coupons which customers can store in their wallet applications
they could be incentivized to visit the merchant locations and spend/indulge. Think: satogram application sending sats with memos including links:
if only there was a way for the application to automate the link to coupon identification/ barcode/nfc creation process....
in this way users could also be genuinely paid in sats to simply walk around areas with participating merchants in this geolocation based sat-advertising.
