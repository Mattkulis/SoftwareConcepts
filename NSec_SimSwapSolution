Problem: Github sucks
Problem2 Simswaps Suck

Carrier Employees susceptible to corruption and bribery to sim swap a client.
as normal people are to phishing attacks.
However, Sim- swapping is indeed a essential service for those who truly need it, ie in the case of cell number recovery due to broken lost or stolon phone/ sim card.

Theory: What if we simply stopped relying on SIM/ SMS for 2FA.
Proposition/ Solution: Instead implementation of a NOSTR Nsec = a Free and easy way for service and user to confirm identity ownership

This framework  provides a way for individuals to now is essentially self-custory their own digital "identites" 
apart from relying on centralized hubs like like what Specific Carrier: (ie TMObile/ Verison), or Platform: (FB/ META)
-email is a little more decentralized due to the sheer quanity of freely available service providers.
But NOSTR has relays, so as long as you can provide them a NPub to hold on file for 2FA, they can easily and seamlessly send users a "is this really you"
to which the users may reply "yes" by signing the message with Nsec, effectively performing an ID verification.
and no barrier to entry other than creating a nostr! -which again is free and easy.


Now a problem this creates is now a way for the layperson to safely secure this Nsec, this too provides an ability for us to create Nsec wallets for multiple digital identities
which we posess.
