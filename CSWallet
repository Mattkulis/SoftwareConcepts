Ability to store gift cards/coupons/ time expiring discounts to stores.
secondary market for selling and purchasing gift cards.
If there was a site where customers picked out goods and generated a cart que. 
(Meaning We know Price and Item number & quantities):
We on the backend can automatically check the submitted card balances and fulfill our customer's purchases.
Then we can turn around and credit the card seller for their card's balance and instantly convert to sats,
(minus the 10-25% of the cards value which is the incentive to the user to use our service because they get discounts.)

Result: Customer gets a discount + card sellers get instant anonymous settlement (in a fixed denomination currency)
in exchange for their gift card's present monetary value.
